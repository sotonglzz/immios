Introduction
 
This
 
document
 
outlines
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
for
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
Instant
 
Marquees
 
Melbourne
 
Internal
 
Operations
 
Software
 
(IMMIOS).
 
The
 
primary
 
goal
 
of
 
this
 
software
 
is
 
to
 
centralize
 
and
 
streamline
 
key
 
operational
 
processes
 
for
 
Instant
 
Marquees
 
Melbourne,
 
including
 
job
 
scheduling,
 
stock
 
management,
 
staff
 
management,
 
and
 
vehicle
 
management.
 
This
 
system
 
is
 
intended
 
for
 
internal
 
use
 
only,
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
improving
 
efficiency,
 
accuracy,
 
and
 
communication
 
within
 
the
 
team.
 
The
 
development
 
will
 
be
 
led
 
by
 
the
 
client,
 
leveraging
 
Cursor
 
AI
 
for
 
code
 
generation,
 
with
 
a
 
target
 
prototype
 
launch
 
by
 
December
 
2025,
 
followed
 
by
 
iterative
 
development
 
cycles.

Business
 
Overview:
 
Instant
 
Marquees
 
Melbourne
 
Instant
 
Marquees
 
Melbourne
 
operates
 
in
 
the
 
Events
 
Logistics
 
industry,
 
specializing
 
in
 
the
 
rental
 
of
 
marquees,
 
umbrellas,
 
and
 
furniture.
 
Services
 
include
 
DIY
 
hire
 
and
 
full
 
delivery/installation.
 
Unique
 
Selling
 
Proposition
 
(USP):
 
Quick
 
response,
 
fast
 
installation,
 
large
 
stock
 
quantity
 
enabling
 
single-vendor
 
solutions
 
for
 
marquee
 
needs,
 
product
 
quality,
 
and
 
excellent
 
customer
 
service.
 
Target
 
Market:
 
Primarily
 
council/government-run
 
public
 
events
 
requiring
 
multiple
 
smaller
 
marquees
 
for
 
market

This
 
niche
 
benefits
 
from
 
Instant
 
Marquees'
 
ability
 
to
 
provide
 
quick
 
installation
 
and
 
removal
 
using
 
"Instant
 
Pop-up
 
Marquees,"
 
differentiating
 
from
 
competitors
 
focused
 
on
 
slower-to-assemble
 
"Structure
 
Marquees"
 
for
 
domestic/wedding
 
events.

goal
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
user-friendly,

system
 
that
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
one-stop

Melbourne's
 
operational
 
day-to-day
 
needs.
 
Specific
 
Objectives:

vehicle
 
management
 
into
 
a
 
single
 
platform.
 
●
 
Improve
 
Efficiency:
 
Reduce
 
manual
 
processes
 
and

resource
 
allocation.
 
●
 
Enhance
 
Communication:
 
Provide
 
real-time
 
updates
 
across
 
the
 
team
 
to
 
ensure

the
 
most
 
current
 
information.
 
●
 
Optimize
 
Resource
 
Allocation:
 
Facilitate
 
smarter
 
decision-making
 
for

and
 
availability.
 
●
 
Increase
 
Accuracy:
 
Maintain
 
precise
 
stock
 
levels
 
and
 
job
 
details.
 
●
 
User
 
Adoption:
 
Create
 
an
 
intuitive
 
interface
 
that
 
is
 
easy
 
for
 
tech-illiterate

learn
 
and
 
use,
 
leading
 
to
 
full
 
internal
 
adoption.

Scope
 
Exclusions
 
(Not
 
in
 
MVP)
 
The
 
following
 
features
 
are
 
explicitly
 
out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
the
 
December
 
2025
 
prototype
 
but
 
may
 
be
 
considered
 
for
 
future
 
phases:
 
●
 
External
 
Customer
 
Access:
 
No
 
client-facing
 
portal
 
or
 
booking
 
system.
 
●
 
Advanced
 
AI/Machine
 
Learning
 
for
 
Suggestions:
 
While
 
the
 
framework
 
for
 
historical
 
data
 
learning
 
is
 
in,
 
advanced
 
AI
 
for
 
highly
 
optimized
 
suggestions
 
(beyond
 
basic
 
availability
 
checks)
 
is
 
out.
 
●
 
Google
 
Maps
 
API
 
Integration
 
(Travel
 
Time/Traffic):
 
Out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
MVP ,
 
but
 
the
 
data
 
model
 
will
 
allow
 
for
 
its
 
future
 
inclusion.
 
●
 
Google
 
Weather
 
API
 
Integration:
 
Out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
MVP.
 
●
 
MYOB
 
Integration:
 
Out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
MVP
 
due
 
to
 
security
 
concerns
 
and
 
complexity,
 
but
 
the
 
codebase
 
should
 
be
 
structured
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
future
 
integration.
 
●
 
Inbuilt
 
CRM:
 
Out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
MVP,
 
as
 
FieldMagic
 
is
 
currently
 
in
 
use.
 
●
 
Deputy
 
Integration:
 
Automatic
 
pulling
 
of
 
staff
 
availability
 
or
 
pushing
 
shifts
 
to
 
Deputy
 
is
 
out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
MVP.
 
Manual
 
input
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
initially.
 
●
 
Complex
 
Reporting
 
&
 
Analytics:
 
Basic
 
data
 
display
 
is
 
in,
 
but
 
advanced
 
custom
 
reporting
 
tools
 
are
 
out.
 
●
 
Mobile
 
App
 
Specific
 
Development:
 
Focus
 
is
 
on
 
web
 
application
 
for
 
PCs.
 
●
 
CRDT
 
Implementation:
 
While
 
real-time
 
updates
 
are
 
in,
 
the
 
complex
 
Conflict-Free
 
Replicated
 
Data
 
Types
 
(CRDT)
 
for
 
true
 
concurrent
 
editing
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
field
 
are
 
out
 
of
 
scope
 
for
 
the
 
MVP .
 
Simpler
 
conflict
 
resolution
 
strategies
 
will
 
be
 
used.
 
6.
 
Technology
 
Stack
 
(Recommended
 
for
 
Cursor
 
AI)
 
Given
 
the
 
client's
 
experience
 
and
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
Cursor
 
AI,
 
a
 
modern
 
JavaScript-based
 
full-stack
 
solution
 
is
 
recommended:
 
●
 
Frontend:
 
React
 
(via
 
Next.js
 
for
 
server-side
 
rendering
 
benefits
 
and
 
project
 
structure)
 
●
 
Styling:
 
Tailwind
 
CSS
 
(for
 
rapid
 
and
 
responsive
 
UI
 
development)
 
●
 
Backend:
 
Node.js
 
(with
 
Express.js
 
or
 
similar
 
framework)
 
●
 
Database:
 
Firestore
 
(for
 
real-time
 
capabilities,
 
scalability,
 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
integration
 
with
 
Firebase
 
ecosystem,
 
which
 
often
 
pairs
 
well
 
with
 
Next.js/React).
 
●
 
Real-time
 
Communication:
 
WebSockets
 
(using
 
a
 
library
 
like
 
Socket.IO
 
or
 
native
 
WebSockets
 
for
 
live
 
updates).
 
●
 
Hosting:
 
Vercel
 
(as
 
requested,
 
for
 
Next.js
 
deployment).

Client
 
Responsibilities
 
●
 
Provide
 
timely
 
feedback
 
and
 
approvals
 
on
 
all
 
documentation
 
and
 
design
 
artifacts.
 
●
 
Be
 
available
 
for
 
regular
 
communication
 
and
 
clarification
 
during
 
development.
 
●
 
Provide
 
all
 
necessary
 
content
 
(text,
 
images,
 
data)
 
as
 
required.
 
●
 
Conduct
 
thorough
 
User
 
Acceptance
 
Testing
 
(UAT)
 
for
 
each
 
release.
 
9.
 
Assumptions
 
●
 
All
 
communication
 
will
 
primarily
 
be
 
text-based,
 
with
 
occasional
 
virtual
 
meetings
 
as
 
needed.
 
●
 
Client
 
(as
 
lead
 
developer)
 
has
 
sufficient
 
technical
 
understanding
 
(Node,
 
Next,
 
HTML,
 
CSS,
 
TypeScript,
 
Python)
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
generated
 
code
 
and
 
Cursor
 
AI
 
effectively.
 
●
 
Cursor
 
AI
 
will
 
be
 
capable
 
of
 
generating
 
functional
 
code
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
provided
 
detailed
 
documentation.
 
●
 
Firebase/Firestore
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
authentication
 
and
 
database.
 
●
 
No
 
complex
 
third-party
 
API
 
keys
 
(e.g.,
 
Google
 
Maps,
 
Weather)
 
are
 
required
 
for
 
the
 
MVP.
