Introduction
 
This
 
document
 
details
 
the
 
functional
 
and
 
non-functional
 
requirements
 
for
 
the
 
Instant
 
Marquees
 
Melbourne
 
Internal
 
Operations
 
Software
 
(IMMIOS).
 
It
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
guide
 
for
 
development,
 
ensuring
 
all
 
critical
 
features
 
and
 
system
 
behaviors
 
are
 
understood
 
and
 
implemented.
 
The
 
requirements
 
are
 
structured
 
to
 
be
 
clear
 
and
 
actionable,
 
particularly
 
for
 
code
 
generation
 
using
 
Cursor
 
AI.
 
2.
 
User
 
Roles
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
primarily
 
support
 
two
 
user
 
roles:
 
●
 
Admin:
 
Full
 
access
 
to
 
all
 
system
 
functionalities,
 
including
 
user
 
management,
 
settings,
 
and
 
all
 
operational
 
modules.
 
●
 
Staff:
 
Access
 
to
 
operational
 
modules
 
(Job
 
Management,
 
Stock
 
Management,
 
Staff
 
Management,

Management)
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
specific
 
roles
 
(e.g.,
 
Rostering
 
Manager,
 
Load
 
List
 
Manager).
 
Permissions
 
within
 
these
 
modules
 
will
 
be
 
managed
 
by
 
the
 
Admin.
